# Knights-Travails

This is a program that calculates the most optimal path for a knight to go from a starting square to a ending square. The chessboard is a special data structure called a modified 2D array. The 2D array consists of "Square" objects. Square objects have a value and contain all the possible squares that a knight could move to from its current position. The search algorithm that finds the most optimal path between the two squares is the Breadth First Search Algorithm. I built a portion of the UI because I was going to make this a web application but decided that moving onto React would be better for me.
