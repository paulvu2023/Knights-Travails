# Knights-Travails

This is a program that calculates the most optimal path for a knight to go from a starting square to a ending square. The chessboard is a special data structure called a modified 2d array. The 2d array consists of "Square" objects. Square objects have a value and contains all the possible squares that a knight could move to from its current position. I was going to make this a web application but decided not to move on with it as I'm going to use my time to learn React instead.
